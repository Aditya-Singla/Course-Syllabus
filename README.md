# Course-Syllabus

Well, the folder contains the official course syllabus for some of the courses I took during my time at IIT Kharagpur. (https://erp.iitkgp.ac.in) 


Note that in some cases, the syllabus might be outdated (such as the professor didn't change the syllabus in the ERP but taught us some other topics departing from the course syllabus) or some content may not have been covered as mentioned in the actual class (sometimes the content may be altered suiting the interest of the class or in some unfortunate cases, the syllabus was not being covered fully due to shorter semester/holidays on days with 2 hours classes when compensatory classes couldn't be arranged). 


Nevertheless, this course syllabus is just meant to gauge the kind of topics usually covered and not necessarily an exhaustive representation of the content taught in that class especially over the years.
